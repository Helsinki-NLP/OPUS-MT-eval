I feel like that I have seen you before.
Let's go there.
You are very pretty today.
Welcome.
Where are you from?
I am eating fried fish.
That chicken was cut by Dom's father in the kitchen.
Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Thy kingdom come, on earth as in heaven. Gives us our daily bread. Forgive us of our sin, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours. Now and forever. Amen.
Who is being naughty?
How are you?
Hope you can understand.
Do you remember your promise?
My mom gave me RM100 to buy necessities.
I will always loving you.
Hold on.
How much is this?
I was given by mother RM100 to buy necessities.
Dom's father is cutting the chicken in the kitchen.

Where is the other one?
What is your name?
You are very handsome today.
I miss you.
"In my vision, I heard an eagle, calling aloud as it flew high overhead, 'Disaster, disaster, disaster, on all the people on earth at the sound of the other three trumpets which the three angels have yet to blow!'"
How to go to this place?
Why didn't you help Tom?
Try to do it like that.
I don't know.
Let's all drink!
I love you.
