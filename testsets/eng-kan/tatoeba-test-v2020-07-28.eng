The story got more and more exciting.
You don't think I can do this, do you?
In my opinion, eastern music is too noisy.
It looks like we got lucky.
I just got back.
Brazil declared war on Argentina in 1825.
Go to the wine cellar and get a couple of bottles of wine.
When does Tom usually go to the gym?
I must be getting home.
Tom is a real competitor.
I traveled by myself.
Tom promised to help me, but he didn't.
I should've gotten up earlier this morning.
That's why he lost his job.
I have enough money to buy a car.
Mary is gorgeous.
I can recommend a good lawyer.
Where can we find the truth?
I saw the girl.
Isn't that what we should be doing?
I'm glad you guys could make it.
To be honest, I really don't know.
He goes abroad every year.
I had to get some money.
What time is it?
My father and my brother work in this factory.
How did you get that scar?
What could possibly have gone wrong?
This is a book.
Tom stayed with me.
Put it back where you got it from.
Just go inside.
Both my father and I went to the museum for the first time.
Tom is very careless.
In order to stay awake I may have to drink more coffee.
Do you know what Tom's last name is?
We're working on it.
They have announced their engagement.
I can tell this is difficult for you.
You shouldn't be here now.
Do you remember?
She treats me as if I were a baby.
One can hardly change one's point of view.
Tom knew who the killer was.
They caught sight of the man among the crowd of people.
Why are you thanking me?
You let me down, Tom.
Last night, I read a book.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell you everything.
The cause of the accident is unknown.
How did it go last night?
She seems shy, but has a strong will in practice.
The only time you talk to me is when you need some money.
It very likely is going to be dangerous.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
I no longer feel that way about you.
You would've gotten away with it if Tom hadn't told on you.
What's going on here?
Would you mind my moving your car?
He bought his daughter a new dress.
You have to tell Tom.
I suggest we don't even try.
Are you finished reading the paper?
You have to tell me exactly what I need to do.
I gave Tom a huge hug.
Can we go inside?
She will be relocated to New Zealand.
She brought up two children.
Do you want to leave it like that?
I've never been to Paris.
You can't be in two places at once.
Tom had almost forgotten.
I really owe you an apology.
They failed to fulfill the conditions.
He couldn't keep his temper any longer.
She got married in her teens.
I'm getting better every day.
My goal is to learn your language.
Tom won't be killing anybody else.
I'll let you know if I find anything interesting.
That's all Tom needed.
We should call off the search.
Some animals are afraid of fire.
I'd like to see the agreement.
He arrived at the station at five.
Let's get it right this time.
From a movie star he became a statesman.
Give my regards to your family.
That's not really a solution.
You need to stay awake.
We were caught in a storm.
He had an accident at work.
You are in love with him.
Do you think it means something?
She tried to get whatever she wanted.
The war is still going on.
I only wish to help you.
Tom stared sadly out the window.
We'll think of another way.
Let's hope we never have to do that.
See you at 2:30.
It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
Where can dollars be exchanged for pounds?
I believe in you.
I don't know what came over me.
I don't see the small car.
Can you speak English at all?
Tom woke up.
Don't let Tom do it.
Don't forget to put out the fire.
I've always believed that.
Give me half.
A few firefighters suffered minor injuries.
I just want to say that I was wrong.
He agrees with my opinion.
Tell us what you know about Tom.
It's my fault that you were fired.
Tom is ready for you now.
I'm sorry I missed your concert.
I forgot Tom was the one who taught you how to play the guitar.
I loved going to the beach.
He swam across the river.
She has something in her hand.
They're useless now.
The boy who came yesterday was my younger brother.
I thought the food was too greasy.
Tom doesn't eat much meat.
These are Tom's glasses, not mine.
It cost twice as much as we expected.
Her voice is better.
His trip will keep him away from the office for a week.
Good morning!
That is your beauty.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Where is the book?
This room looks like a pigsty.
Open your book on page nine.
Do you know what Tom's surname is?
There's nothing in the bucket.
Stupidity is no excuse.
Mr. Sato collapsed from exhaustion.
He took charge of the firm after his father's death.
Tom liked you.
Tom left three hours ago.
This is a horrible tragedy.
What team do you play for?
I made sure that no one was watching.
Let's greet our guests.
There are many new programs to watch this spring.
I didn't know that Tom spoke French.
I don't know how I can ever thank you.
She was very bored during the lecture.
A great deal has happened since that time.
I wondered the same thing myself.
Eat a lot of vegetables.
Can you suggest another solution?
Does Tom have a crush on Mary?
The couple posed for the photograph.
I think that went well.
Did Tom ever hurt you?
Tom told Mary to go home.
The accident caused a traffic jam.
We needed it.
Any time you want to borrow my car, all you have to do is ask.
I come inside to drink coffee.
One of us will have to go.
Let me know your departure in advance.
