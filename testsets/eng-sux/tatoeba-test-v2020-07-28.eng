I'm a farmer.
I'm 12 years old and what is this?
If you can read this, go home!
I don't have children.
Come!
This is my cow.
Close that door!
I'm hungry!
Alas!
I want to tell you something.
My name is Tom.
Don't waste time.
Black clouds were passing above the city.
Set me free!
Hand it over.
Alas.
I'm a hero.
May God help you!
I don't have a wife.
There's one.
I hate you.
Water is life.
I love you.
Give it to me!
Alright.
I am your father.
Tell me your name.
Give it to me.
What is this?
Please spare my life.
I have no wife.
Nothing changes.
I don't know.
Go.
Give me my beer.
You know no shame.
I love you!
Close that door.
Mary is my child.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Send him to me!
Stay home.
I was born on an ill-fated day.
Water is life.
Give it to me.
My name is Tom.
There's one.
Go!
