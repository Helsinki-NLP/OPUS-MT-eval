We eat.
What are you doing?
Tom asked Mary whether she fancied a drink.
I have a stomach ache.
I want to eat.
Put your suitcase over here.
No.
What are you doing?

Put your suitcase over here.

Congratulations to you!
Come here.
Yes, a little bit.
I found you.
Hi! How are you?
Like it?
Again.
I knew what they did to him.
You idiot!
Like it?
My name is Tom.
Go ahead.
Almost.
Mary has a lot of bags.
Have a nice day.
Turn on CNN.
I have a stomach ache.
In New York I lost my way.
I'm Tifyur. I'm not Tafsut.
Why?
I'll eat it here.
I found it.
They have come.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he wanted to drink.
Put your suitcase over here.
Where are you from?
I don't want to.
