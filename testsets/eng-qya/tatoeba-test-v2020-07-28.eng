Happy New Year!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
I hate you.
You are seeing a man.
Your place or mine?
I wish to see.
Our meeting is a pleasure.
Get a life.
Come, Hísiel, we follow him! Stop!
Certainly.
Good night!
Come outside with me and look at the constellations.
I am coming.
They haven't done anything.
My heart sings to see you.
Your hair is pretty.
Are you seeing a man?
They are going.
I'm falling.
Hail, friend.
Good.
Come near the fire.
Cheers!
Hello!
Good morning!
I need to go.
I will love you for better for worse till death us do part.
They are watching.
I see a man between the trees.
Good evening.
Yes.
Hail, friends.
I'm able to speak.
I'm a cat.
I want it.
How are you?
Goodbye!
Thanks!
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
Where do you see him?
This is my home.
Go!
Have a good journey!
Don’t fear.
You are welcome here.
Stand aside, mortals.
Hurray! I have found it!
Certainly.
What goes up must come down.
Hail!
Nenwë is a Noldo.
Men are going.
We all find them.
The king is coming.
The leaf and the tree are falling.
Leaves are falling.
Hurray!
Take off your clothes and lie down on the bed!
Thank you for coming.
Keep off the grass.
The two of you are watching.
I want the book.
Good day!
How are you today?
We wish friendship.
Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Your hair shines like gold.
May you have a lovely day.
Into the fog!
Best wishes!
I don't speak Quenya.
He is falling.
Be seeing you!
I am well.
Hísiel and Nenwë watch the forest.
He is going beneath the shadows.
God is my leader, and my sword is my companion.
You see me.
Merry Christmas!
Become yourself the person you were born to be.
You are watching.
I am a cat.
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
Where shall we go?
The king and queen are coming.
We are watching.
Long journey?
I am happy about our meeting.
A Noldo is beneath the tree.
I'm drowning!
I greet you.
Well met.
Have a good summer vacation!
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
I give greetings to everyone.
I am happy to meet you.
Quenya is an Eldarin language.
Farewell!
We are Noldor. I’m Hísiel. Are you one of the Sindar?
The pair of them is coming.
You are coming.
I am!
You again?
Yes!
No.
Happy Tolkien's birthday!
My home is your home.
We can come again to this place.
Who are you?
May Balrogs eat you.

It has been too long.
Is a Noldo beneath the tree?
Watch the forest!
A leaf is falling.
Hail, guildsister.
