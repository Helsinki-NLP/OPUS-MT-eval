I have a headache.
Snow melts.
Let's cook and eat the fish!
There are a lot of people.
The boy throws a stone.
It snowed yesterday.
Two days ago the wind blew.
The house is cold.
This is my school.
Where are you going to?
Are you going to Noboribetsu tomorrow?
I am a university student.
My knife is sharp.
The boy buys a dog.
I'm a university student.
Your house is big.
My head hurts.
My stomach is full.
My leg hurts.
I have a lot of dreams.
I'm a college student.
"How are you?" "I am fine, thank you."
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog.
Yesterday snow fell.
I am a college student.
My mother is angry.
