The apple is on the table.
I want the book.
The chairs are under the tree.
Nobody wants a war.
Winter is coming.
The book is on the table.
I want ice cream.
The eagle is white.
I speak Lakota.
I'm reading a book.
I'm not old.
I'm thirsty.
The girl is pretty.
The glass is empty.
I don't know.
Yes.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Is your mother at home?
Yes.
I have a white cat.
The room is dark.
