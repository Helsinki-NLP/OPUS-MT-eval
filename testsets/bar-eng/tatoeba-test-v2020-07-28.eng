How much would you pay me?
I was late because I had a flat tire.
Tom was tipsy.
Tom doesn't have a shirt on.
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon.
Tom may win this time.
Fuck off, you stupid idiot!
I've got one like that already.
Let's go outside and sit in the sun.
Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Is Tom afraid?
Tom knew it.
They could do that.
Why does spicy food make you hiccup?
I've got one like that already.
Tom is always broke, isn't he?
You are more stupid than I thought.
Tom has a scar on his right leg.
"I'm leaving." "But you just got here."
You aren't college material.
Can you just hurry up?
We're doing it together.
I knew I could do it.
You haven't yet done what you were supposed to do, have you?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Come on. We don't have all day.
You fooled us.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Let's go do what we have to do.
Get down from that ladder.
You must help her, and soon!
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, hundred.
I can't get out of here.
Tom never drinks wine.
Tom isn't at all upset.
Tom stole money from me.
Let's see what Tom comes up with.
My name is Ludwig.

"How did she get in here?" Through the window".
You're going to need more money than that, aren't you?
Tom gave me everything I needed.
That's such a wonderful movie.
Tom is quite good at chess.
Nobody came to work today.
I've got one like that already.
Tom has been around for a while.
I haven't done that.
I've never used one of these before.
Look at this horrible, watery soup!
I'd just like some peace and quiet.
This is my younger brother.
Tom isn't that kind of guy.
Take your places.
We're still having fun.
You're going to have to do it yourself, aren't you?
Let's go as soon as Tom gets here.
If only I knew!
We knew Tom wanted us to do that.
What songs are you best at singing?
It's taken a while.
My name is Henry.
You can't smoke here.
Tom is finicky.
My name is Jack.
Let's do this while it's still cool.
One egg a day may keep stroke at bay.
You're going to have to do that by yourself, aren't you?
In their language you can write the way you want and don't need to use any commas either.
Has Tom ever told you how he lost his leg?
Why is this only in a foreign language?
Tom only does what he has to do.
Tom gave me everything I wanted.
I love watching golf.
I don't know what to do and neither does anyone else.
I can't hold this fart in much longer!
Tom's bicycle has been stolen.
That's driving you crazy, isn't it?
Let's not get caught doing this.
Tom was really drunk.

Tom got upset.
An onion a day keeps mosquitoes away.
They could never do that.
Tom is always broke, isn't he?
I'm annoyed.
Why is Tom so scared?
Tom has been kicked out of school.
You work fast.
I knew I could do it.
The dog followed him wherever he went.
It'll be really fun.
