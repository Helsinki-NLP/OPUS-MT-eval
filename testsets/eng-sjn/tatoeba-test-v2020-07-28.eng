I need to go.
I am a cat.
Why not?
Your head is empty.
Come near the fire.
Rise for the entrance of the Grand Council!
I'm walking.
Don't worry, you did well.
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
I love to see your eyes shine when you laugh.
Is this a bear?
Run fast!
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
You are welcome here.
I'm a cat.
I love you!
I'm a kid.
No-one knows everything.
Where are we?
Welcome.
Many greetings.
I don't speak Elvish.
I have the best words.
I'm here to help you.
I'm here to save you.
I'm here to save you.
I love to see your eyes shine when you laugh.
I want the book.
I came to save you.
Do you promise?
Elephants eat grass.
I know your face.
Nobody knows everything.
Do you promise?
Don't worry, you did well.
Tom doesn't write.
No one knows everything.
Go kiss an orc.
I'm here to help you.
You are welcome here.
I am happy to see you again.
Greetings!
You betrayed me.
Nice to see you again.
