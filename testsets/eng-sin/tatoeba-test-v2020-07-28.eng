I'm going home.
I am young.
Everything was just so hard.
I don't need a hot bath.
I'll be there in fifteen minutes.
As you wake up, I won't be here anymore.
I think I will have one more ice cream cone.
Do you study any foreign language?
I don't need a hot bath.
I love you.
Is this your wallet?
I am ready.
Thanks!
Good night!
I am short.
Do you study any foreign language?
I help him.
I am tired.
As you wake up, I won't be here anymore.
I am short.
Tom needs to think.
Good morning!
I don't need a hot bath.
I help him.
I can jump.
I think I'll have one more ice cream cone.
I can swim.
I can swim.
Tom broke the window.
Welcome.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
I hate you.
I can swim.
I don't need a hot bath.
I love you.
Do you study any foreign language?
I hear you.
As you wake up, I won't be here anymore.
There are islands in the sea.
As you wake up, I won't be here anymore.
Good evening!
I am right.
I am young.
I love you.
As you wake up, I won't be here anymore.
