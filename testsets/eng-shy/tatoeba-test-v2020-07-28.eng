The sky is clear, but take the umbrella with you, it might rain
Snow falls every day.
Snow falls on the mountains.
Eat bread.
It's a beautiful weather today
Can I ask you a question?
What does she want ?
What do they want ?
Good Night
Bread is dry, water is cold.
Good afternoon
Where is she ?
What do you want ?
Bread is dry, water is cold
I am hungry.
Eat bread and drink water.
