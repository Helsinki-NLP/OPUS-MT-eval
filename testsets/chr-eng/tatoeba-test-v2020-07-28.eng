Do you speak English?
Winter is coming.
Pleased to meet you.
Where is your school?
Where is the bathroom?
Is your mother at home?
I have two cats.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
I want coffee.
I'm happy to see you.
Do you speak French?
The woman is in the room.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I was in the pool yesterday.
I don't see you.
Say it again.
I'm big.
The apple is on the table.
The chairs are under the tree.
I see a white lion.
I don't want to go to school.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
