Wow!
My father is an old man.
Faggot.
This is a book.
Kick it.
I'm well.
I do not understand.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
I want a new dog.
Yes.
Hey.
Welcome.
Whatever!
Hungry?
Study!
I love you blindly.

Congratulations!
Naturally.
My book is not here.
How are you?
Dead?

We are changing the future.
Why?
Definitely!
Turtles don't have teeth.
I am okay.
Long time no see!
Fantastic!
No.
The bird is in the sky.
I feel really tired.
I am eating.
Attention!
Crazy!
Die!
Please speak more slowly.
That is good.
Do you love your mother?
Thanks!
Wrong.
Good morning!

Sami hasn't done this before.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
My sons are not at school.
It is already time to return.
There are many books in the library.
That is nice.
Mary will come with me if she finishes her work.
Fuck!
Did you find what you needed?
I'm from Brazil.
She will miss the train.

Really?
Why are you giving me this money?
I have a grammar book.
Perfect!
Young people today do not listen to adults.
I am fine.
She washed her hair with cold water.
Tom said that he would return to the city in which he had been born.
Enough!
I don't understand.
Awesome!
Obviously.
I'm fine.
I'm the richest.
Ok.
Do they know how to sing?
I don't want to wait that long.
Please.
I invited them home.
Unbelievable!

The house is red.
It is already time to eat dinner.
When he was young, he used to be very shy.
I want a dog.
Did you find what you needed?
Certainly.
And as for you, how are you?
Sorry...
I'm eating.
I can not write.
This thing is good.
I am from Brazil.
Hi.
Tom is a refugee.
Goodbye!
