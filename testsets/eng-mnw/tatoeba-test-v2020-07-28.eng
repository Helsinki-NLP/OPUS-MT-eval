I am hungry because I did not have breakfast.
Where are you going, Dad?
Nice to meet you. How are you doing?
If I were rich, I would do so. As it is, I can do nothing.
What are you doing?
I want to learn.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
Thank you for the present you gave my son.
I go to school because I want to learn.
